# Heading 

## Subheading

### Subheading

In markdown, if you wish to add a paragragh, you simply just need to type in the text. There is no further syntax required for this. 

Adding another paragragh below the first one, just for demonstration purposes. 

do note though that in order for it to be recognised as a paragragh, you will need to have a blank line above and below it. 

You can used code . to open VSCode in the working directory. Do note that code . is an actual function, and in our markdown we would like to make this standout. To do this you can prefix and suffix with **. 
Eg **code .** and you will notice that code . is now in bold. 
Alternativly you can do a double underscore i.e. _code ._ But sometimes depending on the environment you are in, it can just make it italics, 

Best practice for signifying code is to use backtips ``  `code .`
